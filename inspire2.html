<p class="melyna-inspire">INSPIRE 2</p><h5>POWER BEYOND IMAGINATION<br> Starts at x € </h5>
<img src="https://dronerush.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dji-inspire-2-1.jpg" width="100%">
<p class="paprastas-inspire">The Inspire 1 was a revelation. The first filmmaking drone in the world to integrate an HD video transmission system, 360° rotating gimbal and a 4K camera,<br>
as well as the simplicity of app control. The launches of the Zenmuse X5 and X5R cameras further cemented the Inspire as a<br> critical tool for filmmakers around the globe.<br>

The Inspire 2 takes everything that was good about the Inspire 1 and improves it. The image processing system CineCore2.0<br> has been upgraded to CineCore2.1,<br>
recording video at up to 6K in CinemaDNG/RAW and 5.2K in Apple ProRes when used with Zenmuse X7 camera. It goes from 0 to<br> 50 mph (80 kph) in just 5 seconds and
hits a maximum speed of 58 mph (94 kph) and has a max descent speed of 9m/s for unheard of speed and agility in an aircraft this size. A dual battery system<br>
prolongs the flight time to a maximum of 27 minutes (with an X4S), while self-heating technology allows it to fly even in low temperatures.<br>
FlightAutonomy has been revised and developed specifically for the Inspire 2, providing two directions of obstacle avoidance and sensor redundancy.<br>
Increased intelligence adds multiple intelligent flight modes, including Spotlight Pro, giving even single pilots the ability to create complex, dramatic shots.<br>
An upgraded video transmission system is now capable of dual signal frequency and dual channel, streaming video from an onboard FPV<br>
camera and the main camera simultaneously, for better pilot and camera operator collaboration.</p>
