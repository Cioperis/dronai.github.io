<h1 class="melyna">Where Agility Meets Toughness</h1>
<hr>
			<p>Compact and lightweight, DJI Avata is nimble in tight spaces. Every aspect of its design was made for you to be bold. The built-in propeller guard means that if Avata comes in contact with an object, it can bounce back, stay in the air, and can keep on flying.</p>

			<h1 class="melyna">Get in the Pilot's Seat</h1>
				<hr>
			<p>Enjoy next-level comfort and convenience with DJI Goggles 2. Now smaller, lighter, and equipped with Micro-OLED screens, so you experience outstanding clarity as you navigate the sky. DJI Avata also supports DJI FPV Goggles V2. </p>
						<h1 class="melyna">Get a Feel for Flying</h1>
				<hr>
			<p>With the DJI Motion Controller, intuitive flight is in your hands. Squeeze the trigger and bolt forward or turn a corner with the swivel of your wrist. The controls are easy to use and provide a totally unique way to fly.</p>

		<p>In addition to the built-in propeller guard, Avata features downward binocular vision and ToF infrared sensing for even greater safety. These sensors detect obstacles below and allow Avata to perform low-altitude or indoor flight.</p>

			<hr>
			<p>The Avata doesn’t look like any of DJI’s other consumer drones. To fly indoors, around people or in tight spaces, it has prop guards and a small, 7-inch square by 3.1-inch high body.</p>

<h1 class="paprastas"> Flight is accessible to all with the DJI Motion Controller. It follows your hand movements and allows users<br> of all levels to fly with confidence. Shoot 4K/60fps video with the 155° FOV<br> for visuals that stand out. And keep your footage stable with RockSteady and HorizonSteady.</h1>
